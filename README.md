# Multi

Run asynchronous methods sequentially or in parallel.

## About

Multi provides a mechanism to run callbacks asynchronously in sequence, or in parallel.

Execution can be interrupted if there is an error. After all callbacks have finished
executing, the library will provide [err, results], containing the errors (null if none)
and the respective results of the callbacks.

## Installation

To install multi:

    npm install multi

To install multi's dependencies:

    npm install
    
You can also install the dependencies with `make deps`.
    
To run the test suites:

    make test
    
## Usage

Multi works with objects that have asynchronous methods. It creates a wrapper with the same methods as the original,
which can be run either in sequence or in parallel.

The following example wraps the `fs` module in a Multi object, and performs some operations:

```javascript
var fs = require('fs'),
    Multi = require('multi');
  
var mfs = new Multi(fs);

mfs.readFile('./assets/hello.html', 'utf-8');
mfs.readdir('./assets/');
mfs.readFile('./assets/style.css', 'utf-8');
mfs.lstat('./assets/text.txt');

mfs.exec(function(err, results) {
  console.log([err, results]);
});
```

There are several examples provided on the various uses of Multi, available in the `examples/` directory.

## Options

The following options are accepted in the Multi configuration object (second parameter of constructor):

**parallel**: Determines if the methods will run in parallel. Defaults to `false`

**interrupt**: Interrupts execution if an error is encountered. Defaults to `false`

**flush**: Clears the call stack after running `exec`. Defaults to `true`
